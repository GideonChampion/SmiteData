# SmiteData

This is to run data analytics techniques on my smite games, born out of curiosity and further practicing the techniques. 

I want to figure out which gods, builds, and god combos work best for me, as well as whatever other thing I can think of to test. 

This is just for my own use, I won't be publishing an app.
